= Piano

== Intro

I'm learning piano and I'm using this space to document my progress. +  
It's also a place where I can organize all my home-made musical scores. +  
For the creation of the musical scores, I use the following open source applications: +  

* link:http://www.lilypond.org[lilypond] +  
* link:http://www.frescobaldi.org/index.html[frescobaldi] +  

The first application is for creating the musical scores, the second one is a graphical editor,
that makes working with the scores easier.
